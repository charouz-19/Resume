            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <h4>Body</h4>
            My main camera body for the start of my professional career has been a Panasonic Lumix S5, but in 2025 I came into posession of a Leica SL3. The Lumix sticks around as a second body when I need it. I also have various film cameras in my collection for unique analog-look photos.

            <h4>Lenses</h4>
            As all my camera bodies are part of the L-mount system, my lenses are a range of Panasonic full-frame lenses, including the Lumix 70mm f/2.8 and the Lumix 24-60mm zoom. I also maintain a collection of vintage lenses to go with the film cameras or on adapters, such as the Leica 75mm Noctilux.

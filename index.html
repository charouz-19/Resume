            <h2>My Equipment</h2>
            <h4>Body</h4>
            My main camera body for most of my career has been a Panasonic S5, but recently I have come into posession of a Leica SL3. 
            <h4>Lenses</h4>
            As all my camera bodies are part of the L-mount system, my lenses are a range of Panasonic full-frame lenses, including the Lumix 70mm f2.8 and the Lumix 24-60mm zoom.
